# Backlogs 

I've got a number of games and stuff that I want to get beaten before I really sink my teeth into any more.

Lets see... (In no particular order)

#### Games 


| Game | Console | Started ?|
| ---  | :---:   | ----:     |
| Fire emblem awakening | 3DS | Yes |
| Mad Max |PC | Yes -- nearly done|
| Odin Sphere | Vita | Yes |
| Xenoblade Chronicles | 3DS | Yes|
| Earthbound | SNES (3DS) | Yes|
| Xenoblade Chronicles  X | Wii U| Yes|
| Gravity Rush | Vita | Yes|
| Misadventures of Tronne Bonne| PS | No|
| Final Fantasy Tactics | PS | Yes|
| Chrono Trigger | PS| No |
| MGSV | PC |Yep|

&nbsp;

Man I've started a bunch.  Odin sphere and Mad max are a couple I can knock out pretty quickly.  I think I'm going to add a new mandate that I don't get open world games...or maybe like 1 a year.  I just get too distracted and burnt out on them.  Of course this list doesn't count the time I've spent playing multiplayer games like Overwatch, Diablo, and MOBAs.  


#### Books

|Title| Started?|
|---|:---:|
|Defend the realm| Yes |
|Infinite Jest| Yes (I guess?)|
|Junk DNA| No|
|Quantum Computing | No|

I keep up better with my reading...

# The gameplan (get it?)

Right now I'd really like to get fire emblem out of the way.  That one is the hardest to do quickly, battles take 10-30 minutes depending on their size and there is no real way to speed it up.  Mad Max can be a quick finish, I'm a large portion of the way through, but I just keep getting distracted by side missions. After that I want to finish off Odin Sphere, I've already done one of the 5 characters.  The Xenoblade games are going to take awhile, too.
