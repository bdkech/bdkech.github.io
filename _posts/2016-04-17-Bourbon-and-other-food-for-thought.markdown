# Drinkin' and thinkin'

We went back to Four Roses, enjoyed ourselves a great deal again.  Treated myself to a bottle of single batch barrel strength.  This time around I did manage my enthusiam towards learning more about their yeast strains (its the biologist in me).

Some things I'd like to do...


* Finally finish my touch screen raspberry pi with different tools
* Integrate Jekyll with Day One so I can do more blogging and general thought collection on-the-go
* Get Dropbox installed on my linux machine
* Learn markdown and org mode some more (I really need to bite the bullet and just stick with some note-taking scheme can't keep changing it)
* Get some of my lab ipython notebooks published on github, and generally set it up for some of my one-off ideas
* Do more one-off ideas
* I really need to finish my PhD ....
(Do I?)
