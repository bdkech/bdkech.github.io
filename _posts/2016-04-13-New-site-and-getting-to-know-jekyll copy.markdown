# New site

I feel its about that time to refresh the website and tidy it up, it was becoming pretty desolate and dated.  My new objective was to do as much as possible remotely and from the commandline.  Why?  Because I'm a nerd like that.

## Jekyll 

This leads me to using Jekyll.  This lets me do simple blog posts.  I hope to do a bunch of updates based on games I play, tinkering I do, etc. etc.
