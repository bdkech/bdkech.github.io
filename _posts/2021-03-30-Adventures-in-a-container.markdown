Still alive.  PhD done, I'm now a deep learning, AI, and machine learning cog in the technologist machine.  I'm working a lot with containers.  I've been burned by dying computers, changing architecture (looking at you Apple), and updating software enough that I really value Docker.  I've used it to: dashboard my thesis data, host an ad-hoc search engine, share my Doom Level Generator model (oh yeah thats a post for later), and change images out of crappy proprietary formats for model training (maybe another yet another post).  I'm enjoying what tinkering I've done on Kubernetes, but thats all by mini-kube and local work. I haven't had a case yet to necessitate going full production, and that is outside the realm of my group at Work.  Later, once I decide how to host and write, I'll share these experiences and bits of code.  Possibly.
